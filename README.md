# Server-chatroom

Start the server and connect as many clients as you want.

### New feature: 
> Kick user using the command '/kick username'

**Ban command will be added in the next version**<br>
**Note: server commmands can only be executed from the server input functionality**

EDIT: I AM NOT ABLE TO GET A WAY TO GET IPS AND CHECKING THEM SO IF ANYONE HAS ANY IDEA PLEASE MAKE A PULL REQUEST
